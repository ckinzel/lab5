1. Genesis 1:27-28: “So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created 
him; male and female he created them. And God blessed them. And God said to them, 'Be 
fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish 
of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on 
the earth.' "

2. Malachi 2:14-15: “But you say, 'Why does he not?' Because the LORD was witness between 
you and the wife of your youth, to whom you have been faithless, though she is your 
companion and your wife by covenant."

3. Isaiah 54:5: “For your Maker is your husband, the LORD of hosts is his name; and the 
Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer, the God of the whole earth he is called."

4. Song of Solomon 8:6-7: “Set me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm, 
for love is strong as death, jealousy is fierce as the grave. Its flashes are flashes of 
fire, the very flame of the LORD. Many waters cannot quench love, neither can floods drown 
it. If a man offered for love all the wealth of his house, he would be utterly despised."
